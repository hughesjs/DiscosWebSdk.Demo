***DISCLAIMER:***

THIS IS AWFUL CODE, YOU SHOULD NOT WRITE CODE LIKE THIS.

IT IS THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIRED TO ACT AS A GATEWAY.

I MADE IT TO ADDRESS THIS: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65762540/4700841

TL;DR - DISCOS DOESN'T SUPPORT CORS. NO-CORS MODE IN BROWSERS DOESN'T LET YOU SEND AUTH HEADERS.

AS SUCH, WE NEED A GATEWAY TO KEEP CORS ON THE BROWSER HAPPY AND PROXY REQUESTS TO DISCOS.

I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME MAKING THIS GOOD.

DON'T TAKE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW I GENERALLY WRITE CODE

IT WILL BREAK IF YOU HIT THE RATE LIMIT
 
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
